Add a config.js file in the main guideServer folder.

It should look like this

module.exports = { secret: 'Some Random String Of Characters' };

In a new terminal type 'mongod'

cd into the client directory

type 'npm install'

type 'npm start'

In a new terminal cd into the server directory

type 'npm install'

type 'npm run dev'

You should be able to access the starter code on port 8080
